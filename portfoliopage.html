        <div id="desc1" class="description">Contemporary society has seen a sudden and rapid emergence of digital
            platforms and social media. This has allowed
            information to easily promulgate through online mediums such as news sites, personal blogs and other forms
            of media.
            This abundance of information comes with its own set of challenges, such as an increased potential for bias
            as well as a
            motivation to provide sensationalist and subjective news. News outlets, driven by their interests, are
            encouraged to
            distort facts and engage in selective reporting. Furthermore, social media platforms use advanced algorithms
            to
            create personalised content for users, reinforcing echo chambers. This causes people to be continuously
            exposed to
            similar viewpoints, encouraging insular thinking. The method in which news is presented can also be tainted
            with
            specific ideologies and underlying agendas, leading to a potential distortion of information.
            Oraculum aims to address these issues by limiting subjectivity and bias in news. We are launching a project
            that uses a
            Large Language Model (LLM) to provide users with news that is based on fact rather than fiction, allowing
            the general
            population to access objective and untainted information. Oraculum will extract the main essence of news
            articles,
            focusing on facts and minimising emotions and bias in publications. This will be achieved by summarising
            information
            from a range of aggregated similar news sources and emphasising crucial facts instead of emotions within
            individual
            articles. Oraculum aims to become an innovative and unique solution. This project will take further steps to
            remove bias and
            present pure, unadulterated facts. Furthermore, while existing LLM applications are typically general and
            unspecific in
            targeting bias, Oraculum is tailored specifically to address news bias. Oraculum is expected to launch with
            many features
            and methods of use to make products wholly available and attractive to a wide range of demographics.

        <div id="desc2" class="description">The primary aim of this endeavour is to raise awareness about the issue of
            invasive weeds and
            their detrimental impact on the indigenous flora within the Australian ecosystem. These invasive
            species pose a significant threat, impeding the growth and flourishing of native plant life, and
            necessitate disseminating effective weed eradication methods as a critical response to mitigate
            their encroachment. Furthermore, this project endeavours to advocate and promote the
            conservation of native flora, fostering a deeper understanding and appreciation for the intrinsic
            value of these indigenous species. By presenting this information in an engaging and accessible
            manner, particularly targeting a youthful demographic, the project aims to evoke a sense of
            environmental responsibility and appreciation for Australia's unique ecosystem, ensuring a more
            robust and vibrant natural environment for the future.

        <div id="desc3" class="description">The problem space we identified revolves around enhancing the physical
            health management of university students,
            acknowledging the unique challenges they face in balancing academics and well-being. In the fast-paced
            environment of
            the university, time constraints and the lack of individualised guidance contribute to the difficulty of
            maintaining a
            healthy lifestyle. This necessitated the development of a comprehensive solution that incorporates fitness
            monitoring
            with a configurable scheduling component to enable students to effectively manage their physical health.
            Important obstacles, such as crammed schedules and the absence of personalised health advice, prompted us to
            create a
            fitness application tailored to the requirements of university students. The objective was to create a
            product that not
            only monitors fitness activities but also includes a scheduler that enables users to plan exercises around
            their busy
            schedules. This addresses the time constraints faced by students and facilitates the seamless incorporation
            of health
            recommendations into their hectic schedules. The target audience consists of 18 to 25-year-old university
            students pursuing a variety of degrees and frequently
            juggling part-time or full-time employment alongside their studies. The solution satisfies their desire for
            a
            user-friendly application that effortlessly integrates their schedule with workout recommendations,
            providing
            comprehensive health reports and individualised workout suggestions, the solution includes a feature to
            share personal
            achievements on its social platform, to foster a sense of healthy competition.
            Our work plan includes extensive research and feedback methodologies, such as user research and requirements
            assessment,
            competitor analysis, and gap identification. This method seeks to gain insight into students' daily
            activities, problem
            points, and the efficacy of existing solutions. The development schedule includes phases for research,
            prototype
            creation, user testing, and iterations to ensure that the final product meets user expectations and
            preferences.
            In essence, our fitness application is a comprehensive solution that addresses the unique challenges
            confronted by
            university students. It aims to equip them with the knowledge and resources they need to make well-informed
            decisions
            regarding their physical health within the constraints of their busy schedules.
